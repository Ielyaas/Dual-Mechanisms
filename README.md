# Dual-Mechanisms
Repo containing MatLab code for work on models in the following papers:
DOI: 10.1016/j.isci.2020.101062, DOI: 10.1016/j.jtbi.2020.110390

The repo is a little messy. Most files were work in progress files. 
To generate figures and perform any further analysis/validation of the 
model described in the papers above run PLC_model.m

This repo does not contain the codes for generating bifurcation diagrams/sets.
